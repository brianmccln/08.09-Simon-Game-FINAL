## JavaScript Simon Game
#### Simon is a game of short-term memory skill. 
The interface creates a series of tones and lights 
and requires a user to repeat the sequence. 

#### FINAL.jd is just 35 lines, not counting the copious comments. There is no jquery here--just Vanilla JS, which I try to use wherever possible.

#### The mp3 audio files are from Pixabay, which is a great website. Apologies for having to change the mp3 file names for game play purposes, as they have to match the colors of the Simon buttons. There are a couple of alternate mp3 files, if you don't care for the 4 sounds I have chosen.

#### All HTML and CSS is done, so if you are up for the challenge, you "only" have to write the JavaScript.
